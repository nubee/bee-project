Welcome to the bee project.
====================

[bee][bee] is a project automation tool, that makes it easy to automate tasks on
your projects, very similar to [Apache ant][ant] but, since it's developed on
PHP, it's much more flexible, and it's expandable in a easier way.

How bee works
--------------------

[bee][bee] is based on the same concept of [symfony tasks][symfony], so it can
define commands that can have options, attributes, aliases, have full
support of an exception engine, with trace and verbosity, and a colored
interface (even on windows!).

Let's see a common usage

    bee list

will show all the available commands.
